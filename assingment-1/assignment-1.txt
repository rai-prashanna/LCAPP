Since hadware doesn't have semantics defined for data race condition.
It is programmer job to annotate block or varaiale so that two or more threads doesn't work in same memmory localtion
Adding hadware logic is complicated.
 I think compiler writers will generally refuse to promise that it cannot happen. 
 It can be the result of very standard optimization techniques. 
 As far as I know, precluding this behavior with certainty would require significant optimizer 
 redesign.

#Semantic 4.1/4.2 
Trancttion is commited even after exception
After exception the value of update :: 1 
after unitincrement thread , the value of update :: 3

 What is the semantics of the cancel-and-throw statement

Do not consider the outer attribute (Section 8.1) for this exercise.


Write a short (sequential) program that produces different output, depending on
whether the semantics of nesting is flattened, closed or open.
